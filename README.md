# Front-end Portfolio
### 50 Projects in 50 Days or Less

Front-end skills are necessary for any programmer.

### **Why?**

### **_Attention...that's why!_**


Grabbing (and holding) the attention of a client, user, or audience is the single most important skill any business can employ. Our attention is pulled in so many directions, as our minds are led around by *"the next best visual."* 

*_Don't believe me?_* 

Try sitting through a video on YouTube and **NOT** clicking the recommended video list on the right hand side.

Creating visually appealing tech is the first hoop to jump through when your aim is to acquire information about the end user. If you can keep them engaged with a captivating experience, then your business will capture more data as time passes.


This portfolio of miniature projects is my first attempt to consistently **create a program everyday for 50 days.** The portfolio will encompass various creative ideas and tools (mostly front-end tech), and hopefully portray a requisite level of technical ability required to become a full-time professional.


**If you are a recruiter, employer, or hiring manager:**
