# Front-end Skills Portfolio

### > *Consistency transforms average into excellent.*

In my quest to become a software engineer, I've decided that having front-end experience, coupled with my knowledge of Python and Javascript, will expand my collection of problem solving tools.

Front-end skills are necessary for any programmer.



### **Why?**

### **_Attention...that's why!_**



Grabbing (and holding) the attention of a client, user, or audience is the single most important skill any business can employ. Our attention is pulled in so many directions, as our minds are led around by *"the next best visual."* 

*Don't believe me?* 

Try sitting through a video on YouTube and **NOT** clicking the recommended video list on the right hand side.

Creating visually appealing tech is the first hurdle to jump when gathering more information about the end user. If you can keep them focused on your product, then you can harness more data as they invest more of their time.


This portfolio of miniature projects is my first attempt to consistently **create a program everyday for 50 days.** It will encompass various ideas and tools, and hopefully portray a requisite level of technical chops required to become a full-time technology professional.


**If you are a recruiter, employer, or hiring manager:**
